# Numerical-Analysis-Methods-Calculator

### This Numerical Analysis Methods Calculator can perform the following methods:
-Newton-Raphson Method
-Gregory Newton
-Trapezoidal Method
-Simpson's Method

### With the help of the following helper methods:
-polinomAl: Polynomial Input Taker (forms the polynomial by storing the coefficient and the exponent of each term respectively in a 2D array)

-türevF: Derivative Calculator for Polynomials 

-polinomHesap: Polynomial Calculator for the given Value 

-hesaplaAyrikFark: Discrete Difference Calculator Method (calculates the discrete difference between the values of a function at two consecutive points and stores them in a 2D matrix)


This is in fact a course project for "Numerical Analysis" course in Yıldız Technical University. I am not in this university, I just heard about this project from a friend and tried to complete it myself as well.
